THIS REPOSITORY IS NO LONGER MAINTAINED AND WILL BE DELETED EVENTUALLY

Read the BASS documentation for functions/useage

All Functions live in the LuaBASS table

All Enums live in a category table specified by the second word of the enum name (example BASS_ERROR_ALREADY is in LuaBASS.ERROR) with the following exceptions:

Two word enums are in MISC
BASS_OK is in LuaBASS.ERROR

All Enums are doubly keyed (LuaBASS.ERROR.BASS_OK = 0 and LuaBASS.ERROR[0] = "BASS_OK")

All functions take parameters exactly as specified in the BASS documentation and return the bound functions return value and an error code(0 if the function executed ok) excluding the following exceptions:

Init does not take the "win" or "*clsid" parameters and defaults both of these to 0 (this may be changed in the future, or you could change it yourself if you wanted)
GetDeviceInfo returns the return value, a struct mapped to a table, and then the error code
GetInfo returns the return value, a struct mapped to a table, and then the error code
StreamCreateFile does not take the "mem" parameter and defaults this to false
ChannelSetSync does not take the "*proc" or "*user"(but may in the future) and defaults these to the internal SyncDispatcher and NULL

There are a number of helper functions created:
GetDeviceCount returns the number of devices
Flags takes all inputs and ORs them together and returns the resulting value
GetSyncEventList returns a list of sync events since the last time it was called

Todo: 
parameter error handling
bind more methods
